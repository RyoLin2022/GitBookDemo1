The vault gives the holders the confidence of the token price. They don't need to worry about the price since there's a least price of the token. Vault You can use the vault through DApp or bscscan. When someone uses the vault to make the exchange of the token, the BVault token he uses would be sent to the blackhole address (which means it has been permentally burnt) Mechanism Our mechanism contains 4 kinds of taxes 1. Add liquidity pool reward 2. Auto burning 3. Marketing 4. Vault For more details of the mechanism, please check them out on mechanism page.

When trading BVault, some taxes go into the vault, which rises the price of BVault in the vault. When the price in the BVault rises, holders would have more confidence about BVault. Whenever there's a dump, you still don't have to worry about the price because a big amount of BUSD from the tax would be transferred to the vault. With the vault mechanism, the price of the BUSDVault can be risen steadily. "},"MD/BUSDVault/WhyChoose.html":{"url":"MD/BUSDVault/WhyChoose.html","title":"2. Why Choosing BUSD","keywords":"","body":"Why Choosing BUSD?The Bear MarketWhy BUSD instead of USDT?Why Choosing BUSD? Why do we choose BUSD instead of USDT and BNB to be the base of the liquidity pool and the vault. The Bear Market The global economy is not going well these days, so we prefer choosing stable coin to be the base of the LP and the vault. Why BUSD instead of USDT? According to the Reserves Breakdown that Tether and Binance provide. BUSD is having much powerful backup of the US Dollar.

Marketing 4. Vault The detailed mechanism is right below Tax / Category Buying 6 / Add liquidity pool reward 2 / Auto burning 2 / Marketing Selling 6 / Add liquidity pool reward 4 / Vault Adding liquidity pool(LP) The reason that having a LP reward is to enlarge our LP, which could stabilize the BVault price. With more holders holding our LP, the more stable the price is. Everyone becomes a part of the project. Here are some advantages of holding LP in hands: 1. When the price goes up, the more BUSD you'll have 2. When the price goes down, the more BVault you'll have 3. Accoring to our adding LP reward, you can also get BUSD reward from every transaction of the BVault 4. With the larger LP, we can have larger buyers (less price impact) 5. With the larger LP, we can have larger buyers (more stable price) 6. Not only with the BUSD reward, adding LP also does the AMM. 0.3% of the transaction fee would goes to the LP. And it would goes to the LP holders respectively. 7. You are still the owner of your LP. You can remove your LP at any time. Auto burning Since we are a long term project, how can we pump our token ? We decide to have an auto burning tax that makes the BVault more and more rare, since it burns now and forever. With more BVault burnt into blackhole, the circulating supply becomes more less. It leads to the result that 1. The price would be more stable 2. BVault becomes more and more rare So with the auto burning mechanism, holding BVault in hand is also a good choice Marketing All of the token needs marketing, BVault is not excluded. The marketing tax would goes to 3 big parts of directions. 1. KOL posts 2. BVault buyback 3. CEX listing All of the taxes from marketing would be fully goes to marketing Vault Here' s the time to introduce our core mechanism - the vault. The vault gets replenished when someone sells BVault. The more BUSD that the vault has, the more confidence that the holders have. So with the vault, everyone could shrill because the vault is always there. When the price in the DEX ( pancakeswap ) is lower than the vault, you can make exchange from the vault instead of the DEX. The BVault token that exchanges in the vault would goes into the blackhole, which ensures this part of the BVault token can never be sold anymore.
