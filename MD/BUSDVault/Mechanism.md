## Adding liquidity pool(LP)

The reason that having a LP reward is to enlarge our LP, which could stabilize the BVault price.

With more holders holding our LP, the more stable the price is. Everyone becomes a part of the project.

Here are some advantages of holding LP in hands:
    1.  When the price goes up, the more BUSD you'll have
    2.  When the price goes down, the more BVault you'll have
    3.  Accoring to our adding LP reward, you can also get BUSD reward from every transaction of the BVault
    4.  With the larger LP, we can have larger buyers (less price impact)
    5.  With the larger LP, we can have larger buyers (more stable price)
    6.  Not only with the BUSD reward, adding LP also does the AMM. 
        0.3% of the transaction fee would goes to the LP. And it would goes to the LP holders respectively.
    7.  You are still the owner of your LP. You can remove your LP at any time.

## Auto burning
Since we are a long term project, how can we pump our token ?

We decide to have an auto burning tax that makes the BVault more and more rare, since it burns now and forever.

With more BVault burnt into blackhole, the circulating supply becomes more less.

It leads to the result that
    1.  The price would be more stable
    2.  BVault becomes more and more rare

So with the auto burning mechanism, holding BVault in hand is also a good choice

## Marketing
All of the token needs marketing, BVault is not excluded.

The marketing tax would goes to 3 big parts of directions.
    1.  KOL posts
    2.  BVault buyback
    3.  CEX listing

All of the taxes from marketing would be fully goes to marketing

## Vault
Here' s the time to introduce our core mechanism - the vault.

The vault gets replenished when someone sells BVault.

The more BUSD that the vault has, the more confidence that the holders have.

So with the vault, everyone could shrill because the vault is always there.

When the price in the DEX ( pancakeswap ) is lower than the vault,

you can make exchange from the vault instead of the DEX.

The BVault token that exchanges in the vault would goes into the blackhole, which ensures this part of the BVault token can never be sold anymore.
