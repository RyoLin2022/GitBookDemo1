# What is BUSDVault

BUSDVault(BVault) is a BUSD based token empowered by the special vault mechanism.

When trading BVault, some taxes go into the vault, which rises the price of BVault in the vault.

When the price in the BVault rises, holders would have more confidence about BVault.

Whenever there's a dump, you still don't have to worry about the price because a big amount of BUSD from the tax would be transferred to the vault.

With the vault mechanism, the price of the BUSDVault can be risen steadily.
